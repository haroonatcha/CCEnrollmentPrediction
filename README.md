# CCEnrollmentPrediction
All files associated with the enrollment prediction project

## Overview
This project is intended to demonstrate the use of 'stacked' models when predicting enrollment numbers. This should include the following steps

1) Generate data
2) Fit stacked model
3) Fit single model
4) Compare models
5) Write up

## Goals

1) Generate 'enrollment' data that is the output of two different processes at different levels of aggregation
2) Demonstrate comparative advantage of modelling processes differently vs fitting one type of model
3) Write up a short report; aiming for the ~5 page 'report' format in CCJRP
