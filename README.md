# CCEnrollmentPrediction
All files associated with the enrollment prediction project

## Overview
This project is intended to demonstrate the use of 'stacked' models when predicting enrollment numbers. This should include the following steps

1) Generate data
2) Fit stacked model
3) Fit single model
4) Compare models
5) Write up

## Goals

1) Generate 'enrollment' data that is the output of two different processes at different levels of aggregation
2) Demonstrate comparative advantage of modelling processes differently vs fitting one type of model
3) Write up a short report; aiming for the ~5 page 'report' format in CCJRP

## Notes for Abby

- I added a diagram for how I think the data generation process should go
- 'Processes' that involve model fitting or generation are cylinders
- Let me know if my diagram makes any sense

I tried to be as explicit as possible in writing out how i think this data should be generated. I didn't go into detail on the variables I was thinking of using, but i think sticking to a simple process is best, so a limited number of variables will be best. I was thinking: gender and cumulative credit load at the individual level and GDP at the semester level.
