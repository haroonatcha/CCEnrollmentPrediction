	abstract = {As part of an effort to reassess its enrollment forecasting methodology and techniques, the Florida Division of Community Colleges conducted a national survey of state directors of community/junior colleges to identify successful forecasting practices. A conceptual framework for analyzing responses was developed from a review of the literature on enrollment projections and used to summarize the state of the art of enrollment forecasting. Four categories of approaches were identified: (1) trend extrapolation approaches, i.e., curve-fitting techniques, such as simple and moving averages, which utilize historical enrollment data as the basis for projections, and causal models, such as cohort-survival techniques, which give consideration to independent factors in addition to historic  enrollment data; (2) subjective judgments, which involve the use of expert opinion or futuristic approaches; (3) combination approaches, which use both extrapolation and subjective methods; and (4) no state-level forecasting. The survey revealed that nine of the 46 responding states conducted no systematic state-level forecasting; 12 states used curve-fitting techniques; 18 states used causal models; one state based its enrollment projections solely on subjective judgment; and six states reported using combination approaches. The survey report details methodology and findings by state and concludes with observations on responsibility for, success of, and desirability of enrollment forecasting. (AYC)},

	abstract = {Enrollment forecasting is the central component of effective budget and program planning. The integrated enrollment forecast model is developed to achieve a better understanding  of the variables affecting student enrollment and, ultimately, to perform accurate forecasts. The transfer function model of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methodology and linear regression model are major forecasting techniques. The structural approach embedded in the models allows the researcher to construct candidate models,  eliminate inappropriate ones, and retain the most suitable model. In addition, the expert system for the ARIMA model is a supplementary tool used to verify the resulting models in terms of model structure and forecasting accuracy. The enrollment series of interest is the 1962-2004 student enrollment for Oklahoma State University (OSU). Fifteen independent variables are used in an attempt to increase explanatory power. These variables include  demographics (Oklahoma high school graduates and competitor college enrollment from the  University of Oklahoma), state funding, economic indicators, (e.g., state unemployment rate  and gross national product), and one-year lagged demographics and economic indicators.  The best ARIMA and linear regression models yield remarkably high R-squared values and exceptionally small mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs), respectively. Moreover,  they contain two identical demographics: Oklahoma high school graduates and one-year  lagged OSU enrollment. Hence, the first-order autoregressive models appropriately depict the  longitudinal and aggregated OSU enrollment series. An additional linear regression model shows that one-year lagged Oklahoma high school graduates and three economic indicators significantly contribute to OSU enrollment. This integrated enrollment forecast model has demonstrated its model validity and accuracy. Hence, it could be replicated for comparable universities elsewhere. (A bibliography is included.

Accurate short‐term enrollment forecasts provide valuable information to administrators for budgeting, planning, and (in the case of state supported institutions) negotiating with funding agencies. This research suggests that Box‐Jenkins (ARIMA) models may be used to produce accurate short‐range forecasts of seasonal enrollment data. One‐step ahead (one academic quarter ahead) forecast errors of Full Time Equivalent Students (FTES) for the Virginia Community College System are on the order of 3.6\% with errors increasing in magnitue to 5.6\% for forecasts one year into the future. The methodology employed in this paper to forecast VCCS enrollments can be adapted easily and inexpensively to forecasting enrollments at other institutions.},

The goal is to predict the total enrollment headcount that is composed of new (freshman and transfer), continued and returned students. The proposed approach builds predictive models for new, continued and returned students, respectively first, and then aggregates their predictive results from which the model for the total headcount is generated. The types of data utilized during the mining process include population, employment, tuition and fees, household income, high school graduates, and historical enrollment data. Support vector machines produce the initial predictive results, which are then used by a tool called Cubist to generate easy-to-understand rule-based predictive models. Finally we present some empirical results on enrollment prediction for computer science students at California State University, Sacramento},

Apart from business, it plays a vital role in higher education planning. Higher education plays an important role in a nation's socioeconomic development. As an educational management tool, predictive analytics can help improve education quality by letting us analyze critical issues in education such as enrollment management and curriculum development.

	abstract = {Colleges are increasingly interested in identifying the factors that maximize their enrollment. These factors allow enrollment management administrators to identify the applicants who have higher tendency to enroll at their institutions and accordingly to better allocate their money rewards (i.e., scholarship and financial aid). In this paper we identify factors that affect the likelihood of enrolling. We use machine learning methods to statistically analyze the enrollment predictability of such factors. In particular, we use logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVMs) and semi-supervised probability methods. The LR and the SVMs methods predict the enrollment of applicants at an individual level whereas the semi-supervised probability method does that at a cohort level. We validate our methods using real data for applicants admitted to the university of New Mexico (UNM). The results show that a small set of factors related to student and college characteristics are highly correlated to the applicant decision of enrollment. This outcome is supported by the relatively high prediction accuracy of the proposed methods. [For the full proceedings, see ED593090.]},
